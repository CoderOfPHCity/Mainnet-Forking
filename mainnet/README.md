# Uniswap V2 Mainnet Fork Project
Description
This project encompasses a script designed to interact with the Uniswap Router contract using Solidity and Hardhat. By forking the Ethereum mainnet, it showcases how to engage with the Uniswap router contract efficiently.

## Features
Interaction with the Uniswap router contract through two distinct functions.
Utilization of Solidity and Hardhat for script development.
Real contract interaction on the Ethereum mainnet facilitated by network forking.
## Prerequisites
Before executing the script, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
Hardhat
## Installation
Clone the repository:
``bash``
Copy code
``git clone <repository-url>``
